        Although it looks a little complicated, the idea and process of calculating a Taylor series
        requires a bit of computation, but a lot of patter recognition. To start, it is easier to 
        look at what is known as a Taylor Polynoimal, which is just a finite number of terms of the
        series, rather than the infinite series itself. To that end, consider the following example.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Construct a third-degree Taylor polynomial of <m>f(x)=e^x</m> centered at <m>c=1</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                To construct the third-degree Taylor Polynomial for the function, it is perhaps best
                to consider a table of values that calculates <m>\displaystyle f^{(k)}(c)</m>, 
                <m>k!</m> to easily determine the value of <m>\displaystyle \frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{k!}</m>.
                These will be the coefficients of the polynomial.
