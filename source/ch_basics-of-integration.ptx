    <title>Basics of Integrals</title>
    <introduction>
        Even though this book is meant for those who are in a hurry to understand calculus, it is
        important to slow down sometimes and look at a concept deeply. The next concept—Riemann
        Sums—is a good example. However, if you're truly in that big of a hurry to get to the
        calculus of integrals, you can skip to the next chapter to start calculating integrals using
        helpful tricks similar to how derivatives were calculated. Before we get started, we need to
        learn some new notation that will be useful for writing certain calculations.
