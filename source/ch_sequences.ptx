    <title>Sequences and Series</title>
    <introduction>
        In this chapter, we introduce the concept of a sequence and define convergence and divergence of a sequence. 
        We will then use the concept of a sequence to build the sum, different, or alternating sum and difference of
        the sequence of numbers to build a series. We will also develop techniques to analyze sequences and series
        and utlize those techniques to determine if a sequence and serice converges or diverges.
