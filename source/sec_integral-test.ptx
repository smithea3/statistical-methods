    <title>The Integral Test</title>
    <p>
        The previous sections in this chapter have shown the fundamentals of series. Now, the 
        question that will be addressed is: does this series converge or diverge? To answer
        this question, mathematicians have created "tests" that help to determine if a series
        converges or diverges.

            This will be said quite a few times in this section, but the results of the tests 
            developed in this section DO NOT give the value to which a series converges. It is like
            a test you might take a doctor's office. For example, you might go to the doctor feeling
            under the weather and they test you for the flu. The test says you are positive for the 
            flu, but the test does not tell you which specific strand of the flu you have. Testing
            for convergence is nearly the same idea: the test will determine if it converges, but
            it will not tell you the value to which it converges. For that, the idea of a 
            <term>power series</term> is needed.

                For each of the following series, determine if the series converges or diverges. You
                must use a test or a well-known series (i.e. geometric, telescoping, etc.) to prove the
                convergence AND divergence. If the series is a well-known series that the value of the
                convergence can be found, then find the value of convergence.

                    The series is geometric; therefore, it converges since <m>r=1/8</m>, which is 
                    less than one. The value to which the series converges to is

                    First, we check if the Divergence Test provides any information about the 
                    series. Since the sequence is always positive and monotonically 
                    decreasing, we can apply the Integral Test. Consider the integral

                    The series involves a power function.

                    This series is a p-series with <m>p=\frac{1}{3}</m>, and it converges since <m>p &gt; 1</m>.

                    This series is geometric; therefore, it converges since 
                    <m>r=\frac{1}{{\ln(5)}}</m>, which is less than one. Therefore, the series 
                    converges to the value of

                    The series is always positive, eventually monotonically decreasing, and
                    can be integrated using Integration by Parts.

                    To find convergence, we first check that conditions of the Divergence Test.
                    Since the sequence of the summand goes to zero, the Divergence Test is
                    inconclusive. Next, we consider the conditions of the Integral Test. The 
                    sequence is always positive, and if <m>k>3</m>, then the sequence is
                    monotonically decreasing. Therefore, we can apply the Integral Test.

                    Since each piece of the antiderivative contains a <m>e^{-x}</m> term, the 
                    values at infinity will be zero. Therefore, the only parts that remain are when
                    <m>x=1</m>, which is <m>5e^{-1}</m>. Since the integral converges, we can 
                    conclude that the series also converges by the Integral Test.

                    Since the values of the argument of the natrual logarithim are always increasing,
                    the logarithim is, therefore, always increasing. So, this limit goes to 
                    infinity. This means that the improper integral diverges. Therefore, by the
                    integral thest, the series also diverges.
