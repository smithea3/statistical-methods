        <p>
            This section provides an introduction to the concept of a power series. A full definition
            of a Power Series is developed, along with the conditions under which a power series
            converges to a function.

        <title>Power Series Centered at Zero</title>
        <p>
            Consider the following definition of a power series that is centered at zero.
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-power-series-centered-at-zero">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>\{a_k\}_k</m> be a sequence and <m>x</m> be a variable, then
                    <me>
                        \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kx^k=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+x_3x^3+\cdots+a_kx^k+\cdots
                    </me>
                    is called a <term>power series</term>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <remark>
            <p>
                One of the most pabis power series (centered at zero) occurs when <m>\{a_k=1\}</m>, which
            is the power series
            <me>
                \sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k=1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots+x^k+\cdots
            </me>
            A closer look at this series shows that it is nearly identical to the geometric series, 
            where the common ratio is the variable <m>x</m>. Therefore, this series will converge when
            <m>|x| &lt; 1</m>, which can also be written as <m>-1 \leq x \leq 1</m> or
            <m>x\in(-1, 1)</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, now only do we know that a geometric series converges when the conditions 
                of the common ratio are satisfied, we also know to what the geometric series converges.
                In this case, we can then state that if <m>|x| &lt; 1</m>, then
                <me>
                    \sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k=1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots+x^k+\cdots = \frac{1}{1-x}.
                </me>
            </p>
        </remark>
        <p> 
            When studying power series, and later when we apply power series to other things, we want
            to determine for what values of x will the power series converge. We do this by connecting
            it back to the geometric series. Remember that the geometric series converges when <m>|r| &lt; 1</m>. 
            So, it would be only natural that we look at the absolute convergence of the power series 
            and determine for what values of <m>x</m> the power series converges absolutely.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Determine the value of <m>x</m> for which the series 
                    <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{1}{1+2^k}x^k</m>
                    converges.
