                    A culture of barteria obeys the law of uninhibited growth and follows a model <m>
                    A(t)=A_0e^{kt}</m>. If 500 bacteria are present initially, and there are 800 after
                    one hour, answer the following questions. 
                </p>
            </statement>

                <statement>
                    <p>
                        What is the uninhibited growth equation that models this growth?
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Since there are initially 500 bacteria, we know that <m>A_0=500</m>. This means
                        we have the equation <m>A(t)=500e^{kt}</m>. Knowing that after one hour there 
                        are 800 bacteria, we also know that <m>A(1)=500e^{k\cdot1}=800</m>.
                        Solving for <m>k</m> give the value of <m>k=\ln(8/5)</m>. Substitution that
                        back into the equation, and with some simplification, we find that 
                        <me>
                            A(t)=500\left(\frac{8}{5}\right)^t.

                    <p>
                        How many bacteria will be present in the culture after 5 hours?

                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Using the formula that we found in the last part, we have that 
                        <me>
                            A(5)=500(8/5)^5=5242.88.

                <solution>
                    <p>
                        To find the time, we set the growth equation equal to the number of bacteria and
                        solve for <m>t</m>.

                    How much money must be invested today at 12% interest compounded quarterly in
                    order to have $20,000 in 10 years? Additionally, how long will it take for
                    $5,000 to double if the $5,000 is invested at 7% compounded continously?
                </p>
            </introduction>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    (1) For the first part of this question, since we want to determine an end amount,
                    we should first look at the equation for this account, where the only
                    unknown variable is the starting amount, which we'll call <m>A_0</m>.
                    Therefore, the growth equation for this investment is 
                    <me>
                        A(t)=A_0\left(1+\frac{0.12}{4}\right)^{4\cdot t} = A_0(1.03)^{4t} = A_0(1.1255)^{t}
                    </me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setting this equation equal to 20000 and using 10 for the years, we can solve for <m>A_0</m>.
                    I will use the <m>A_0(1.03)^{4t}</m> version of the equation to ensure the greatest level
                    of accuracy.
                    <md>
                        <mrow> A_0(1.03)^{4\cdot 10} \amp = 20000 </mrow>
                        <mrow> A_0 \amp = \frac{20000}{(1.03)^{40}} </mrow>
                        <mrow> A_0 \amp \approx  6131.14 \text{ (rounded to the nearest penny)}</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) To answer the second part of the question, we consider the formula for continous
                    compounding, which is <m>\displaystyle A(t)=A_0e^{rt}</m>. Furthermore, since we
                    want the investment to double to $10,000, and we start with $5,000, we set the
                    equation equal to $10,000 with the given rate and solve for <m>t</m>.

                    Environmentalists often capture an endangered species and transport the species to a controlled
                    environment where the species can produce offspring and regenerate its population. Suppose
                    that six American bald eagles are captured, transported to a wildlife reserve in Montana,
                    and set free. Based on experience, the environmentalists expect the population to grow

                    Solve the homogeneous differential equation.
                    <me>
                        (x-y)dx+xdy=0

                    We can rewrite the differential equation by dividing everything by 
                    <m>dx</m>, which produces the new differential equation
                    <me>
                        x-y+x\frac{dy}{dx}=0
                    </me>
                    This differential equation can be written as <m>xy'-y=-x</m>. Dividing
                    by <m>x</m> converts the differential equation to the standard form
                    of a first-order linear differential equation:
                    <me>
                        y'-\frac{1}{x}y=-1
                    </me>
                    Using an integrating factor of <m>\mu(x)=e^{\int\frac{1}{x}\,dx}</m>,
                    We get that <m>\displaystyle\mu(x)=\frac{1}{x}</m>.
