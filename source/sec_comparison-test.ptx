    <title>The Comparison Tests</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Up to now, we have seen special, well-known series that we have shown to either 
            converge or diverge based on specific conditions. This is not always the case.
            So, we must develop some more powerful tools in order to determine if a 
            series converges or not. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A word of warning. In the next few sections, as we develop the different types
            of test for convergence, do not assume that if a test gives a specific number
            that the number you get is the summation of the series. That is rarely, if ever,
            the case for convergence tests.

        <theorem xml:id="thm-direct-comparison-test">
            <title>Direct Comparison Test</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>\displaystyle \sum_k a_k</m> and <m>\displaystyle \sum_k b_k</m>
                    be infinite series where <m>0 \leq a_k \leq b_k</m>. If
                    <m>\displaystyle \sum_k b_k</m> converges, then <m>\displaystyle \sum_k a_k</m>
                    also converges. Contrapositively, we can say under the same conditions that 
                    if <m>\displaystyle \sum_k a_k</m> diverges, then <m>\displaystyle \sum_k b_k</m>
                    also diverges.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>
        
        <p>
            It can be helpful to think of this type of comparison in one of two ways: when trying
            to show that a series converges, then try to find a convergent series that is
            just a little bit larger than the given series. This way, if the series is a little bit
            larger, and it is known to converge, then the smaller series must also converge.
        </p>

        <p>
            Likewise, when trying to show that a series diverges, try to find a divergent series
            that is a little bit smaller than the given series. This way, if the series is smaller,
            but diverges to infinity, then the larger series (the given series), must also diverge.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This creates a stop-or-push relationship with the two series. For convergence, try to find a
            stoping point (larger series) that is known to converge. This will create an upper bound for
            the given series, and then the convergence can be concluded. For divergence, the goal is to
            find a series that is smaller and therefore pushing the given series off to infinity.
        </p>

        <example>
            <p>
                Use the Direct Comparison Test to show that 
                <m>\displaystyle \sum_k\frac{3}{(1+2k)^2}</m> converges.
            </p>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To use the Direct Comparison Test to show convergence, the "stop" relationship
                    must be considered. Therefore, a series that is larger than the given series,
                    but converges must be found. Since it is true that <m>3k^2 &lt; (1+2k)^2 </m>
                    for all <m>k &gt; 1</m>, it is also true that <m>\frac{3}{(1+2k)^2} &lt; \frac{1}{k^2}</m>
                    and therefore, <m>\displaystyle\sum_k \frac{3}{(1+2k)^2} &lt; \sum_k\frac{1}{k^2}</m>.
                    The convergence of <m>\displaystyle \sum_k\frac{1}{k^2}</m> is known by the p-series
                    test, and the relationship. So, it can be concluded that <m>\displaystyle\sum_k \frac{3}{(1+2k)^2}</m>
                    also converges by the Direct Comparison Test.

                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
                Determine if <m>\displaystyle \sum_k \left(\frac{\sin(k)}{k}\right)^4</m> converges
                or diverges.

            <solution>
                <p>
                    The summand of the given series can be rewritten as 
                    <m>\displaystyle \sum_k\frac{\sin^4(k)}{k^4}</m>. This proves helpful because it is also
                    true that <m>0 \leq \sin^4(x)\leq 1</m>. Therefore, it is true that 
                    <m>\displaystyle \frac{\sin^4(k)}{k^4} \leq \frac{1}{k^4}</m> for all <m>k &gt; 1</m>. Additionally,
                    since <m>\displaystyle \sum_k \frac{1}{k^4}</m> is known to converge by the p-series 
                    test, then the given series must converge also by the Direct Comparison Test.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
                Determine if <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{11^k}{4+18^k}</m> converges or
                diverges using the Direct Comparison Test.
            </p>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    It is good to stop and take note that the summand looks a lot like a geometric
                    series, especially if the denominator did not have the plus four in it. Also,
                    it is true that <m>18^k &lt; 4+18^k</m>, which implies that 
                    <m>\displaystyle \frac{1}{4+18^k} &lt; \frac{1}{18^k}</m>. Since the series
                    <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{18^k}</m> is geometric and the 
                    common ratio is less than one and 
                    <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{4+18^k} &lt; \sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{18^k}</m> 
                    it can be concluded that the given series must also converge by the Direct Comparison Test.

        </theorem>

        <example>
            <p>
                Use the limit comparison test to determine if 
                <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{2k+1}{k^2+2k+1}</m> converges or diverges.

                <p>
                    First, it is important to note, and get in the habit of checking, that the 
                    divergence test is inconclusive here because the summand, as a sequence, goes
                    to zero. To use the Limit Comparison Test, a sequence must be used that behaves in a 
                    similar way that the given series behaves. A closer look at the given series 
                    shows that at infinity, the terms of the summand will look a lot like 
                    <m>\frac{1}{k}</m>. Therefore, the Harmonic Series is a great candidate to use 
                    for this series. So, consider the following limit:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{a_k}{b_k} \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{\frac{2k+1}{k^2+2k+1}}{\frac{1}{k}} </mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{2k+1}{k^2+2k+1}\cdot\frac{k}{1} </mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{2k^2+k}{k^2+2k+1} </mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp = 2 </mrow>
                    </md>
                    So, by the Limit Comparison Test, since the value of the limit is a positve real
                    number, then the two series behave like each other. Since the series 
                    <m>\sum_k\frac{1}{k}</m> is known to diverges (Harmonic Series),
                    then it can be concluded that the given series also diverges.

                For each of the following series, determine if the series converges or diverges. You
                must use a test or a well-known series (i.e. geometric, telescoping, etc.) to prove the
                convergence AND divergence. If the series is a well-known series that the value of the
                convergence can be found, then find the value of convergence.

                    Use the direct comparison test to prove convergence. Note that

            <solution>
                <p>
                    Since the Divergence Test is inconclusive, and the series does not look
                    to be easily integrable, we will consider the comparison tests. For this
                    series, the direct comparison test is a good candidate because 
                    <m>2^k &lt; 2^k + k</m>, which means that <m>\frac{1}{2^k+k} &lt; \frac{1}{2^k}</m>.
                    Moreover, we know that <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^k}</m> converges
                    because it is a geometric series where <m>r=1/2</m>. Therefore, 
                    <me>
                        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^k + k}\leq\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^k} = 1
                    </me>
                    So, we can conclude by the direct comparison test that <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^k + k}</m>
                    also converges.

                    The Divergence Test is inconclusive since the summand goes to zero. We could
                    check the convergence/divergence of this series by the integral test,
                    since the sequence is always positive and monotonically decreasing. However,
                    it is easier to show that since <m>n^2 &lt; (n+1)^2 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{(n+1)^2} &lt; \frac{1}{n^2}</m>, 
                    then <m>\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+1)^2} &lt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}</m>.

                    It is known that <m>\sum_{\theta=0}^{\infty}\frac{2}{10^\theta}</m> converges because it

            <solution>
                <p>
                    Using the recursive definition of the factorial, we can simplify the summand 
                    as follows: <m>\displaystyle \frac{k!}{(k+1)!}=\frac{k!}{(k+1)k!}=\frac{1}{k+1}</m>.
                    Using this information, we can rewrite the series as <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{1}{k+1}</m>.
                    This series is a candidate for the <xref ref="thm-limit-comparison-test"/>: the 
                    Limit Comparison Test. Choose <m>b_k=\frac{1}{k}</m>, then
                    <md>

                    </md>
                    Therefore, since the limit is a positive real number, and the series
                    <m>\sum_k b_k</m> diverges, then so does the given series.

                <p>
                    We can begin by noticing that if we look only at the behavior of the summand
                    at infinity, then we have a summand that looks like 
                    <m>\frac{k}{k\sqrt{k}}=\frac{k}{k^{1.5}}=\frac{1}{k^{0.5}}</m>.
                    This makes the series a candidate for using <xref ref="thm-limit-comparison-test"/>.
                    Let <m>b_k=\frac{1}{k^{0.5}}</m>, then 
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{a_k}{b_k} \amp =\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{\frac{k-2}{k\sqrt{k}}}{\frac{1}{k^{0.5}}} </mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{\sqrt{k}(k-2)}{k\sqrt{k}} </mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp = 1 </mrow>
                    </md>
                    Therefore, since the limit is a positive real number, and the series
                    <m>\sum_k b_k</m> diverges, then so does the given series.

                    <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{e}=1</m>. So,

                    This allows you to consider either the Direct Comparison Test or

                    Therefore, for all <m>n \geq 0</m> 
                    <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=2}^\infty\frac{1}{k} \leq \sum_{k=2}^\infty\frac{\sqrt[n]{e}}{n}</m>.
                    Since <m>\sum_{k=2}^\infty\frac{1}{k}</m> is the Harmonic Series, which is known
                    to diverge, then the given series must also diverge by
