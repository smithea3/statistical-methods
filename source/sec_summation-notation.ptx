    <title>Summation Notation</title>
    <p> The main idea of calculating integrals is simple: we want to calculate area. It is the
        execution of that simple idea that makes the concept of integrals more interesting and
        challenging to calculate. To calculate area under different functions, we will need to
        symbol that mean "to add". In mathematics, we use the capital letter "S" in Greek 
        (<m>\Sigma</m>) to denote summation. 
    </p>
    <p> We can use this summation notation to short hand summation in this way. Say we wanted to
        write the sum of the positive integers from 1 to 10. We can do this using summation notation
        in the following way 
        <me>
            \sum_{k=1}^{10} k.
        </me>
    </p>
    <p> In this example, the letter <m>k</m> is called the "index" of the summation. The value of <m>
        k=1</m> is the initial value, and the value of <m>10</m> is the terminal value. Expanded
        out, this summartion would look like this: 
        <me>
            \sum_{k=1}^{10} k=1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10=55.
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>The index of the summation always increases by 1 each time. So, if you want to make it
        interesting and count another way, you would have to think of a way to do so. Let's look at
        the next example to see what this means.</p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>Find the sum of the first 10 even numbers.</p>
        </statement>
        <answer>110</answer>
        <solution>
            <p>Since we want to add the first <m>10</m> even numbers, we first need to figure out the expression that gives the
                even numbers. Using <m>k</m> as the index again, if <m>2k</m> is the expression,
                where <m>k=1</m> is the initial value and <m>k=10</m> is the terminal value, then this
                would give use the first ten even numbers. As a summation, this would look like 
                <me>
                    \sum_{k=1}^{10} 2k=2+4+6+8+10+12+14+16+18+20=110
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>If you look at this a little closer, then you see that we could factor out a 2 from
                the expanded part of the equation and have 
                <me>
                    \sum_{k=1}^{10} 2k=2(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)=2\cdot55=110
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an important property of summation that allows us to factor out common
                factors like to to make certain computations easier.
