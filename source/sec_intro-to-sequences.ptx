    <title>Introduction to Sequences</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            To begin our look at sequences and series, we start with the basics of a sequence. In
            this section we will develop the basic properties and notation for a sequence, look at
            different types of sequences, and use techniques from differential calculus to analyze
            if a sequence converges or diverges.

    <definition xml:id="def-sequence-of-reals">
        <statement>
            <p> A <em>sequence of real numbers</em>, which we write as <m>\left\{a_k\right\}_k^\infty</m>, is
                a function whose inputs are from the set of positive integers and their outputs are
                to the set of real numbers. The inputs are typically denoted with an <m>k</m> or an <m>
                n</m> and is called an <em>index</em>. The output, denoted <m>a_k</m> or <m>a_n</m>
                is called the <m>k</m>th term of the sequence. </p>
            <p>    
                We can condense this definition using mathemtical notation by writing <m>k\in\Z^+</m>
                such that <m>a(k):\Z^+\to\R</m>. 
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    
    <p> 
        It is important to note that the index of the sequence is always <m>\Z^+</m>, but the output
        is dependent upon the definition of the sequence. Let's begin by looking at a few examples.
    </p>

        <statement>
            <p>
                Below are a few examples of various sequences. As you read them, see if you can
                determine the pattern that gives the next term in the sequence.
                <md>
                    <mrow> \amp 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \dots </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, \dots</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \dots </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp 1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, \dots </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp e, e, e, e, e, \dots </mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </example>
    
    <p> 
        As you tried to determine the next term in <xref ref="ex-seq-1" />, did you notice that some
        sequences looked like familar formulas and others were best described based on their previous
        term? For example, in the second sequence (<m>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, \dots</m>), the next term is the
        sum of the previous two terms. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Sequences that are best describe by a close-form formula are <em>explicitly defined</em> and
        sequences defined by previous terms are <em>implicitly defined</em>. In fact, the sequence <m>0,
        1, 1, 3, 4, \dots</m> is a well-known sequence called the <em>Fibonacci sequence</em>. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        We can write the Fibonacci sequence in the notation of sequences by writing <m>\displaystyle
        \left\{ a_{k-2}+a_{k-1} \,|\, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1 \right\}_k^\infty</m>. Notice here how the first
        two terms of the sequence is already defined. Another important recursively-defined sequence
        that we will utlize in this chapter is the <em>factorial sequence</em>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To quickly review the concept of a factorial, consider the following scenario. You want to
        create a playlist of song. You have 10 songs from which to choose. How many different lists
        can you make if you cannot repeat songs on the playlist and the order of the playlist is
        important. Since you can choose from any of the 10 songs from the first choice, but only
        nine for the second, eight for the third, seven for the fourth, etc., you would calculate
        the total by multiplying these choices together.
        <me>
            10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdots2\cdot1=3,628,800
        </me>
        We condense this expression by writing <m>10!</m>, which we read aloud as "10 factorial."
